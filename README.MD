setting change to authenticated


notice!!!!!!!!!! maybe i will have problem with the permission decorator because it needs to have the prefix of flightapp.
<!-- user in models has null=true because it gives error (needs to be changed) -->

i changed customer group permission so a cust can update flight (otherwise he cant book a seat)

<!-- i should handle situation where authorization key is not provided -->
delete flight

if unlogged user wants to book flight he must login/ sign up
handle where i delete things that doesnt exist
 
formik to add airline company
